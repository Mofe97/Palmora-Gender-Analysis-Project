# Palmora-Gender-Analysis-Project
My Project Documentation on the Palmora Group on Gender pay gap among the employees. As an analyst, I Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address.
Gathered all neccessary data needs for my analysis.
The Data were cleaned and prepared for further analysis.
I assigned generic gender to Replace missing gender values.
Employees with out gender were filtered out
I remove Null rows from the data
I Ensure region, department, gender, rating, and salary columns are complete and accurate.
Department rating, Annual Bonus, and the salary bands were analysed

I used Visualization tools to Analyse my Data
From my Analysis the Palmora Group have a total of 946 staffs, 3 Locations.
481 Females and 465 Males. There are More Female Employees in Palmora Group

Palmoria Group doesnt meet the requirements for a minimum pay of $90,000, 
Because some employees earn less than $90,000.
But employees who earn a close range of $80,000-$90,000 and $90,000 are more than those who earn less.
Out of 481 Females in the Organization, 140 Females Earns $90,000, the remaining 341 Earns below the Minimun Pay of $90,000
Out of 465 Males in the Organization , 152 Males Earns $90,000, the remaining 313 Earns below $90,000

From my Analysis in the Salary Gap. The Male Employees Average Salaries are Slightly higher than the Female Employees
Legal Department, Earn $90,000 More in the Organization
Staffs with the Highest $90,000 Pay are from Kaduna State, followed by Abuja state, and Lagos State.

The Palmora Group Should Look into Each Departments and Locations for Employees Earning Below $90,000 and work on increment, as $90,000 is the regulated Minimum Salary to be paid for all Employees.
